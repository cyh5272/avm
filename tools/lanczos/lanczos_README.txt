LIBRARY
#######

The main library source and header files are:
lanczos_resample.c
lanczos_resample.h


UTILITIES
#########

Two utilities are provided to resample y4m and yuv videos respectively:
lanczos_resample_y4m (built using source lanczos_resample_y4m.c)
lanczos_resample_y4m (built using source lanczos_resample_yuv.c)

Another utility simply returns the filter parameters for a given
resampling configuration:
lanczos_resample_filter (built using source lanczos_resample_filter.c)

lanczos_resample_y4m
--------------------
The usage of lanczos_resample_y4m is:
  lanczos_resample_y4m
      [<Options>]
      <y4m_input>
      <num_frames>
      <horz_resampling_config>
      <vert_resampling_config>
      <y4m_output>
      [<outwidth>x<outheight>]

  Notes:
      <Options> are optional switches prefixed by '-' as follows:
          -bit:<n>        - providing bits for filter taps
                                 [default: 14]
          -ieb:<n>        - providing intermediate extra bits of
                            prec between horz and vert filtering
                            clamped to maximum of (15 - bitdepth)
                                 [default: 2]
          -ext:<ext_type> - providing the extension type
               <ext_type> is one of:
                    'r' or 'rep' (Repeat)
                    's' or 'sym' (Symmetric)
                    'f' or 'ref' (Reflect/Mirror-whole)
                    'g' or 'gra' (Grafient preserving)
                                 [default: 'r']
          -win:<win_type> - providing the windowing function type
               <win_type> is one of:
                    'lanczos'     (Repeat)
                    'lanczos_dil' (Symmetric)
                    'gaussian'    (Gaussian)
                    'gengaussian' (Generalized Gaussian)
                    'cosine'      (Cosine)
                    'hamming      (Hamming)
                    'blackman     (Blackman)
                    'kaiser       (Kaiser)
                                  [default: 'lanczos']

      <y4m_input> is the input video in Y4M format
      <y4m_output> is the output video in Y4M format
      <num_frames> is number of frames to be processed
      <horz_resampling_config> and <vert_resampling_config>
              are of the form:
          <p>:<q>:<Lanczos_a>[:<x0>] where:
              <p>/<q> gives the resampling ratio.
              <Lanczos_a> is Lanczos parameter.
              <x0> is the optional initial offset
                                 [default: centered]
                  If used, it can be a number in (-1, 1),
                  or 'c' meaning centered.
                      which is a shortcut for x0 = (q-p)/(2p)
                  or 'd' meaning co-sited chroma with centered
                      luma for use only on sub-sampled chroma,
                      which is a shortcut for x0 = (q-p)/(4p)
                  The field can be prefixed by 'i' meaning
                      using the inverse of the number provided,
          If it is desired to provide different config parameters
          for luma and chroma, the <Lanczos_a> and <x0> fields
          could be optionally converted to a pair of
          comma-separated parameters as follows:
          <p>:<q>:<Lanczos_al>,<lanczos_ac>[:<x0l>,<x0c>]
              where <Lanczos_al> and <lanczos_ac> are
                        luma and chroma lanczos parameters
                    <x0l> and <x0c> are
                        luma and chroma initial offsets
      <outwidth>x<outheight> is output video dimensions
                             only needed in case of upsampling
      Resampling config of 1:1:1:0 horizontally or vertically
          is regarded as a no-op in that direction

Example usages:

1a. Downsample 10 frames from Boat_1920x1080_60fps_10bit_420.y4m by
    ratio 3/2 horizontally and 4/3 vertically with Lanczos parameter

1b. Reverse the process in 1a. That is, upsample 10 frames from
    /tmp/boat.y4m by ratio 3/2 horizontally and 4/3 vertically with
    Lanczos parameter 6 for both and centered sampling. The output
    dimension desired is specified to be 1920x1080.

                         1920x1080

4a. Similar to 3a, except using symmetric border extension instead of default
    repeat.

    and centered chroma vertically. Note this is the most common use
    case encountered in practice.

    lanczos_resample_y4m Boat_1920x1080_60fps_10bit_420.y4m 10 \
                         2:3:6:c,d 2:3:6 /tmp/down.y4m

                         /tmp/downup.y4m 1920x1080
lanczos_resample_yuv
--------------------
The usage of lanczos_resample_yuv is similar but with two extra
arguments to specify the input format:
    lanczos_resample_yuv
      [<Options>]
      <yuv_input>
      <width>x<height>
      <pix_format>
      <num_frames>
      <horz_resampling_config>
      <vert_resampling_config>
      <yuv_output>
      [<outwidth>x<outheight>]
  Notes:
      <yuv_input> is the input video in raw YUV format
      <yuv_output> is the output video in raw YUV format
      <width>x<height> is input video dimensions.
      <pix_format> is one of { yuv420p, yuv420p10, yuv420p12,
                               yuv422p, yuv422p10, yuv422p12,
                               yuv444p, yuv444p10, yuv444p12 }
      All other parameters are the same as the ones used for
      lanczos_resample_y4m described above.


lanczos_resample_filter
-----------------------
Utility to show the filter parameters used for both luma and chroma.
The usage of lanczos_resample_filter is:
  lanczos_resample_filter
      [<Options>]
      <resampling_config>
  Notes:
      <resampling_config> is in the same format as one specified
          in lanczos_resample_y4m above for <horz_resampling_config>
	  or <vert_resampling_config>.

Example usages:

7a. lanczos_resample_filter -bit:14 2:3:6
        (shows 14-bit a = 6 filter for 2/3 resampling, x0 = centered)
7b. lanczos_resample_filter -bit:12 1:2:5:0.125
        (shows 12-bit a = 5 filter for 1/2 resampling, x0 = 0.125)
7c. lanczos_resample_filter -bit:12 1:2:5:c,d 12
        (shows 12-bit a = 5 filter for 1/2 resampling,
	 x0 = centered for luma, co-sited for chroma)
7d. lanczos_resample_filter -bit:12 3:2:6:i0.125 12
        (shows 12-bit a = 5 filter for 3/2 resampling, x0 = inverse of 0.125)


SCRIPTS
#######

In addition to these utilities, two convenience scripts are provided:
lanczos_downup.sh
lanczos_downcompup.sh
They can be invoked from the build directory directly after a build that
produces lanczos_resample_y4m, aomenc and aomdec applications.

lanczos_downup.sh
-----------------
The script lanczos_downup.sh resamples a video with specified parameters
and then reverses the process using two lanczos_resample_y4m commands.
The usage for the script is:

  Usage:
    lanczos_downup.sh [<Options>]
                      <input_y4m>
		      <num_frames>
                      <horz_resampling_config>
                      <vert_resampling_config>
                      <downup_y4m>
                      [<down_y4m>]

  Notes:
      <Options> are optional switches similar to what is used by
          lanczos_resample_y4m utility
      <y4m_input> is input y4m video
      <num_frames> is number of frames to process
      <horz_resampling_config> and <vert_resampling_config> are in format:
              <p>:<q>:<Lanczos_a_str>[:<x0>]
          similar to what is used by lanczos_resample_y4m utility, with the
          enhancement that for <Lanczos_a_str> optionally
          two '^'-separated strings for 'a' could be provided instead
          of one for down and up-sampling operations respectively if different.
          Note each string separated by '^' could have two values for luma
          and chroma separated by ','.
          So <Lanczos_a_str> could be of the form:
              <a_luma_down>,<a_chroma_down>^<a_luma_up>,<a_chroma_up>
            if down and up operations use different parameters, or
              <a_luma_down>,<a_chroma_down>
            if down and up operations use the same parameters.
      <downup_y4m> is the output y4m video.
      <down_y4m> provides the intermediate resampled file as an
          optional parameter. If skipped the intermediate resampled
          file is deleted.

Example usages:
8. Similar to combined use cases 1a and 1b above including both
down and inverse up steps.

8a. From build directory run:
    /path/to/script/lanczos_downup.sh Boat_1920x1080_60fps_10bit_420.y4m \
        10 2:3:6 3:4:6 /tmp/downup.y4m
            [Here the intermediate resampled files is not stored]

8b. From build directory run:
    /path/to/script/lanczos_downup.sh Boat_1920x1080_60fps_10bit_420.y4m \
        10 2:3:6 3:4:6 /tmp/downup.y4m \
        /tmp/down.y4m
            [Here the intermediate resampled file is stored in /tmp/down.y4m]

8c. From build directory run:
    /path/to/script/lanczos_downup.sh Boat_1920x1080_60fps_10bit_420.y4m \
        10 2:3:8^4 3:4:8^4 /tmp/downup.y4m
            [Here Lanczos parameters 8 and 4 are used for down and upscaling
             respectively]

8d. From build directory run:
    /path/to/script/lanczos_downup.sh Boat_1920x1080_60fps_10bit_420.y4m \
        10 2:3:6,4^6,4:c,d 3:4:6,4^6,4 /tmp/downup.y4m
            [Here Lanczos parameters 6 and 4 are used for luma and chroma
	     respectively for both down and upscaling. Further centered
	     luma and co-sited chroma are used horizontally, while centered
	     luma and chroma sampling are used vertically.]

lanczos_downcompup.sh
---------------------
The script lanczos_downcompup.sh resamples a video with specified parameters
using lanczos_resample_y4m, then comprsses and decompresses using aomenc and
aomdec respectively, and finally reverse resamples the decompressed video to
the source resolution using another lanczos_resample_y4m command.
The usage for the script is:

  Usage:
    lanczos_downcompup.sh [<Options>]
                          <input_y4m>
			  <num_frames>
                          <horz_resampling_config>
                          <vert_resampling_config>
                          <cq_level>[:<cpu_used>]
                          <downcompup_y4m>
                          [[<down_y4m>]:[<downcomp_bit>]:[<downcomp_y4m]]

    Notes:
        <Options> are optional switches similar to what is used by
            lanczos_resample_y4m utility
        <y4m_input> is input y4m video
        <num_frames> is number of frames to process
        <horz_resampling_config> and <vert_resampling_config> are in format:
                <p>:<q>:<Lanczos_a_str>[:<x0>]
            similar to what is used by lanczos_resample_y4m utility, with the
            enhancement that for <Lanczos_a_str> optionally
            two '^'-separated strings for 'a' could be provided instead
            of one for down and up-sampling operations respectively if different.
            Note each string separated by '^' could have two values for luma
            and chroma separated by ','.
            So <Lanczos_a_str> could be of the form:
                <a_luma_down>,<a_chroma_down>^<a_luma_up>,<a_chroma_up>
              if down and up operations use different parameters, or
                <a_luma_down>,<a_chroma_down>
              if down and up operations use the same parameters.
        <cq_level>[:<cpu_used>] provides the cq_level parameter of
            compression along with an optional cpu_used parameter.
        <downcompup_y4m> is the output y4m video.
        The last param [[<down_y4m>]:[<downcomp_bit>]:[<downcomp_y4m]]
            provides names of intermediate files where:
                <down_y4m> is the resampled source
                <downcomp_bit> is the compressed resampled bitstream
                <downcomp_y4m> is the reconstructed bitstream.
            This parameter string is entirely optional.
            Besides if provided, each of <down_y4m>, <downcomp_bit> and
            <downcomp_y4m> are optional by themselves where each can be
            either provided or empty. If empty the corresponding
            intermediate file is deleted.

Example usages:
9. Similar to use cases 8 above with a compression step in between.

9a. From build directory run:
    /path/to/script/lanczos_downcompup.sh Boat_1920x1080_60fps_10bit_420.y4m \
        10 2:3:6 3:4:6 40:5 /tmp/downup.y4m
            [Here no intermediate files are stored.
	     Compression is at cq_level 40 and cpu_used=5]

9b. From build directory run:
    /path/to/script/lanczos_downcompup.sh Boat_1920x1080_60fps_10bit_420.y4m \
        10 2:3:6 3:4:6 40:5 /tmp/downup.y4m \
        /tmp/down.y4m::/tmp/downrec.y4m
            [Here the resampled source and its compressed reconstruction are
             stoted in /tmp/down.y4m and /tmp/downrec.y4m respectively.
	     Compression is at cq_level 40 and cpu_used=5].

        /tmp/down.y4m:/tmp/down.bit:/tmp/downrec.y4m
            [Here the resampled source, its compressed bitstream, and the
             conpressed reconstruction are stoted in /tmp/down.y4m,
             /tmp/downcomp.bit and /tmp/downrec.y4m respectively.
	     Compression is at cq_level 40 and cpu_used=5].
